# My beginner-website
Creating my first website! I don't know HTML or CSS at all so it
might take some time! Don't expect anything too fancy though.

My website can be viewed at: https://brenleung.github.io/beginner-website/index.html

Currently my website has a homepage, a contact page, and an about me page.
With these I have learned how to:
* Insert links
* Divide my HTML code into custom classes
* Create headers
* Insert a GIF
