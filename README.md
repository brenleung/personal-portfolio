# My beginner-website
Creating my first website! I don't know HTML or CSS at all so it
might take some time! Don't expect anything too fancy though.

My website can be viewed [here](https://brenleung.netlify.app/).

Currently my website has a homepage, a contact page, and an about me page.
With these I have learned how to:
* Insert links
* Divide my HTML code into custom classes
* Create headers
* Insert a GIF
* Create a working sidebar
