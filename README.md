# Personal Portfolio
This contains all the code for my first website/my personal portfolio. All
of this code gets updated frequently and are pushed automatically to Netlify,
where the website is being hosted.

My website can be viewed [here](https://brenleung.netlify.app/).

## Why
Having had free time at my current job that allows me to explore my interests,
I decided to pursue frontend by creating websites through HTML/CSS. The first
step was creating a personal portfolio, as I realized many developers often
have a website to showcase their work.

## The Process
Overall, it took roughly 3 months to create the website. It is still getting
updated to this day. It came with a lot of trial and error because I did not 
know how to properly create a website, but in the end, it is a functioning
website!<br>

Currently, my website has a homepage, contact page, about me, resume, and projects page.
One of the most recent challenges was the project page. Originally, I had it
with very text-heavy dropdowns, but this was very hard to look at and was not
user-friendly. Instead, I wanted to implement clickable cards. This took a bit
of time because I had trouble centering the cards with responsive photos. In addition,
I wanted the cards to link to another website, but I had trouble getting an entire
div to be clickable, but found a workaround using JavaScript.

In the end, I got a product that looks like this: <br/>

## Conclusion
In the end, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoyed creating this
website. Having done this, while I was confused about my computer science path
before, I have committed to aspiring to be a frontend developer!

With this project I have learned how to:
* Insert links
* Divide my HTML code into custom classes
* Create headers
* Insert a GIF
* Create a working sidebar
* Create clickable cards
* Insert basic JavaScript scripts
